      <h1>Structure of the Indian Army</h1>
      <p>
        The Indian Army's structure is designed to ensure optimal coordination and combat readiness. It is broadly divided 
        into three categories: Combat Arms, Combat Support Arms, and Services. This hierarchical framework enables seamless 
        functioning during wartime and peacetime operations.

    <h2>Infantry</h2>
<p>The infantry regiment is the largest element of the Infantry division. The infantry regiments engage and destroy the enemy in close combat during the assault or hold its position during the defence.</p>
<p>It is a military organisation, not a field formation. They are equipped, organized and trained to use weapons of close combat to support its assault weapons with heavy fires and to provide limited administrative support for its units. The infantry is completely air transportable. The infantry battalions are:</p>

    <h2>Armoured Corps</h2>
    <p>Armoured warfare or tank warfare is the use of armoured fighting vehicles in modern warfare. The premise of armoured warfare rests on the ability of troops to penetrate conventional defensive lines through use of maneuver by armoured units. Much of the application of armoured warfare depends on the use of tanks.</p>
    <p>It currently consists of 63 Armoured regiments, including the President's Bodyguards. The naming of the regiments varies. The terms "Cavalry", "Horse", and "Lancers", which have been dispensed with in the case of units raised post-independence, are historical legacies from the raising and renaming of these units when part of the East India Company's army and/or the later British Indian Army.</p>
    <p>A few Armoured Regiments are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>President's Bodyguards</li>
        <li>2nd Lancers</li>
        <li>17 Horse (The Poona Horse)</li>
        <li>62 Cavalry</li>
        <li>1st Skinner Horse</li>
        <li>9 Horse or "The Deccan Horse"</li>
        <li>10 Armoured Regiment</li>
        <li>90 Armoured Regiment</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Mechanised Infantry</h2>
    <p>The Mechanised Infantry is responsible for giving infantry battalions greater mobility. They are infantry equipped with armoured personnel carriers for transport and combat. Its carriers provide a degree of protection from hostile fire. It is one of the youngest regiments of the Army. It has taken part in several operations including Op Pawan in Sri Lanka, Op Rakshak in Punjab and J&K, and Op Vijay in J&K. It also specializes in UN peacekeeping operations in Somalia, Congo, Angola, and Sierra Leone.</p>
    <p>A few Mechanised Infantry battalions are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1st Bn (former 1st Bn, The Madras Regt)</li>
        <li>3rd Bn (former 1st Bn, 8 Gorkha Rifles)</li>
        <li>8th Bn (former 7th Bn, Punjab Regt)</li>
        <li>13th Bn (former 18th Bn, Rajput Regt)</li>
    </ul>

<section>
    <h2>Academy Regiment of Artillery</h2>
    <p>The Artillery Regiment (AR) constitutes almost one-sixth of the Army's total strength, with units organized on a Corps and Divisional basis. The main task of Artillery is to dominate the battlefield with its immense firepower, ensuring that the enemy cannot interfere with operations effectively.</p>
    <p>Some of the Artillery Regiments include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>9 Parachute Field Regiment</li>
        <li>12 Medium Regiment</li>
        <li>315 Field Regiment</li>
        <li>37 Coorg Anti-Tank Regiment</li>
        <li>17 Parachute Field Regiment</li>
        <li>40 Field Regiment (Asal Uttar)</li>
        <li>821 Light Regiment Bombers</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Corps of Engineers</h2>
    <p>The Corps of Engineers consists of three major constituents: Combat Engineers, Military Engineering Service (MES), and Border Roads Organisation (BRO). Combat Engineers provide mobility to own forces by constructing bridges, tracks, and helipads, while denying the enemy similar benefits by creating obstacles like mines and demolishing bridges.</p>
    <p>The MES is responsible for the design, construction, and maintenance of all works, buildings, and airfields, and the BRO helps in the construction of roads, highways, airfields, and bridges.</p>
    <p>A few notable engineer groups are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Madras Sappers</li>
        <li>The Bengal Sappers</li>
        <li>The Bombay Sappers</li>
