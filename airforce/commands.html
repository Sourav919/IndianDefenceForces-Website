        <h2>Western Air Command - New Delhi</h2>
        <p>
            The origin of the Western Air Command can be traced back to the nascent years of independent India, when the various formations of the Air Force were organised into two groups. 
            These were the No 1 Operational Group which controlled all the flying units including the flying training units and the No2 Training Group responsible for the entire spectrum 
            of training activities (except flying training) in the IAF.
        </p>
            <p>On 22 July 1949 the No 1 Operational Group was re-designated as the Operational Command. The Air Officer Commanding the Operational Command was then of the rank of an Air
             Commodore. This was upgraded to the rank of Air Vice Marshal in 1958 and later to the rank of Air Marshal. The Command assumed its present name of Headquarters Western Air 
             Command on 10 June 1963, primarily as a consequence of formation of other operational commands and demarcation of specific areas of responsibility.
            </p>
            <p>Headquarters Western Air Command, located at Subroto Park, New Delhi, has over 50 bases placed under its command and has been involved in all major operations in India
             since independence. Due to its geographical location the Command has always been the hub of all operational activities during any operation. Some of the major operations
              handled are Kashmir Operations 1947-48, Sino-Indian Conflict 1962, Indo-Pak War 1965, 
            Indo-Pak War 1971, Operation Pawan 1986 (Sri Lanka) and Operation Safed Sagar 1999 (Kargil) and Operation Snow Leopard at Eastern Ladakh 2020 (Galwan Valley)

        <h2>Eastern Air Command - Shillong</h2>
        <p>
            HISTORY OF EASTERN AIR COMMAND:<br>

            One of the lethal arms of the Indian Air Force, Eastern Air Command (EAC) controls air operations over a vast area that straddles 12 states. It includes the seven
             north eastern states, Sikkim, West Bengal, Bihar and parts of Orissa and Jharkhand covering over three lakh square kilometres. The area of responsibility includes a 6300 km long international boundary with China, Nepal, Bhutan, 
            Myanmar and Bangladesh. The headquarters of EAC is housed in a spectacular location in Shillong, also called the ‘Scotland of the East’. Apart from the operations 
            from permanent air bases, this command takes immense pride in facilitating airlift and air supplies to remote areas in the country’s far east.</p>
            
            
            

            <p>SHIFTING OF HQ EAC TO SHILLONG:<br>
            The necessity of increased transport support in the East was felt after the 1962 Indo - China conflict. At the same time formation of few other 
            Commands in other parts of the country was also felt inevitable. The HQ EAC set-up of Kolkata was shifted to Allahabad on 10 Jun 1963 by redesignating 
            it as Central Air Command (CAC). On the same day, No.1 Group moved from Tezpur to Shillong and was upgraded to HQ Eastern Air Command. It then started 
            functioning as a full-fledged Air Command from a few old barracks of the Second World War at Nonglyer village.</p>

        <h2>Central Air Command - Prayagraj</h2>
        <p>
            Indian Air Force had undergone a major expansion process during the 1950s wherein the command and control structure was reorganised. The No.1 Operational Group of 1947 at 
            Calcutta was revived in 1958 and was given the responsibility of organising and supervising the aerial operations of the IAF in the 
            Eastern as well as the Central sector of the country. Post Chinese aggression of 1962, further requirement of change was felt and the area of responsibility of this
             Operational Group was bifurcated in two separate commands. Accordingly, Central Air Command (CAC) was formed in March 1962 to keep vigil along the Indo-Nepal boundaries
              at Rani Kutir, Kolkata. But keeping in view the area of responsibility of CAC, the location of Kolkata was found too skewed towards East. Therefore, in February 1966,
               HQ CAC was shifted to Bamrauli, Allahabad. Presently, the area covered by CAC ranges from the snow peaked mountains in the North to the Gangetic plains and centre highlands.
          </p>
          <p> Central Air Command with its motto of ‘Damniyah Atmashatravah’ (Vanquish The Enemy) has an enviable and exemplary record during war and peace time services to the
             nation. As one of the premier Commands of the Indian Air Force, Central Air Command has evolved with time and has seen a paradigm shift in the employability of airborne 
             platforms. Vintage and legacy fleets have been replaced with more potent and lethal platforms. Aircraft such as the versatile Canberra, Spitfire, Liberator, Gnat, MiG-25,
              Packet, AN-32 and Mi-4 have been made way for modern aircraft such as the Mirage 2000, Su-30 MKI, Jaguar, the high performance Airborne Warning and Control System, IL-76, 
              Mi-17 and ALH..

        <h2>Southern Air Command - Thiruvananthapuram</h2>
        <p>
            As a response to the changed geopolitical situation around southern peninsula since early eighties, Southern Air Command was established on 19 Jul 84 with its
             Headquarters at Thiruvanthapuram. Superpower rivalry in Indian Ocean and attempts to destabilise the littoral states with continued ethnic problems in Sri Lanka 
             compelled the defence planners to create capacities   to effectively defend the Island territories and protect our exclusive economic zones. A need was, therefore,
              felt to establish an Operational Air Command covering the geopolitical area of peninsular India, extending to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal
               and Lakshadweep Islands in the Arabian sea. On 20 Jul 84, Smt Indira Gandhi, the then Prime Minister inaugurated Headquarters of Southern Air Command at ‘Belhaven Palace’, 
               an old palace of Maharaja of Travancore located in the heart of Thiruvanthapuram city, with Air Mshl TJ Desa as the first AOC-in-C.
 </p>
     <p>       The aim of the formation of this Command and the units under it, was to create a ready basic Op infrastructure which enabled quick deployment of combat forces
             in the event of sudden threats developing in peninsular India and our island territories. The CCPA stipulated Mini Wings at Sulur, Chennai (later location was
              shifted to Thanjavur) and Port Blair (which was interchanged with Carnicobar). Forward Base Support Units (FBSUs) were stipulated at Thiruvananthapuram, Bangalore, 
              Visakhapatnam, Agatti (Lakshadweep), Carnicobar (which was interchanged with Port Blair), Great Nicobar and AF Station Suryalanka. Subsequently Port Blair, Carnicobar
               and Great Nicobar were placed under HQs Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC) after its formation. With the increase in strength of personnel and operational relevance,
                construction of permanent accommodation for the Command Headquarters was envisaged. Subsequently, the construction of permanent Command Headquarters was completed
                 and Headquarters moved from Belhaven Palace to Akkulam on 08 Aug 1996. Headquarters Southern Air Command, continues to expand with the induction and operationalisation
                 of new assets. It has the distinction of having effectively executed all air operations in Sri Lanka and Maldives (Op Pawan and Op Cactus respectively).

        <h2>South Western Air Command - Gandhinagar</h2>
        <p>
            Jai Shree Varte Veeram, meaning victory garlands the gallant, is a bye word to the soul and spirit of one of the most operational commands of the Indian Air Force, 
            the South Western Air Command.
        </p>
            <p>Originally established as No 1 Operational Group at Jodhpur on 21 Sep 1972, it was subsequently rechristened as the South Western Air Command on 23 Jul 1980. The operational 
            area, carved out of the Western Air Command, included most of Rajasthan and the entire Gujarat. he crest of the South Western Air Command depicts the national emblem on the 
            top as a pendant of a garland of flowers with "Dakshin Paschim Vayu Kaman" encrypted inside in a semi circle. The centre is adorned by a dagger with wings. At the base, under 
            the inscription 'Bharatiya Vayu Sena', is a scroll with the command motto "Jai Shree Varte Veeram".
            </p>
            <p>In a major expansion in the mid eighties, the units located at Pune and Mumbai were transferred from Central Air Command. 
            
            Goa area of Southern Air Command was also added to the jurisdiction of this Command. Thus, the entire south western area of the country came under the air defence umbrella 
            of SWAC. Keeping in view the increasing operational importance of the command, it was decided by Air HQ to move the Command Headquarters from Jodhpur to Gandhinagar. The new
             HQ was inaugurated on 01 May 1998 by the then Chief Minister of Gujarat, Shri Keshubhai Patel. The grand ceremony held on the occasion included a fly 
            past by fighters and helicopters, an aerobatics display by SU-30 and Surya Kiran aircraft and a free fall display by the Akash Ganga para-jumping team.

        <h2>Training Command - Bengaluru</h2>
        <p>
            The first batch of six Indian Air Force officers was trained at Royal Air Force College, Cranwell, UK between 1930 and 1932. Until 1939, the pilots inducted into the IAF
             continued to be trained at Cranwell. Technical officers were also trained in the UK, while the technicians (airmen) were trained at Aircraft Depot, Karachi, under the 
             supervision of British Non-Commissioned Officers.
             In September 1939, during the outbreak of World War II, the IAF had a strength of 16 officers and 144 airmen (then called Hawai Sepoys).
        </p>
        <p>
            The first Flying Training School was improvised from a squadron based at Risalpur, where, both initial and advanced training were carried out. No.1 Initial Training Wing
             (ITW) was formed at Walton in Lahore in 1940 for training IAF officer cadets in discipline, drill, physical activities and elementary ground subjects. A School of Technical 
             Training was set up 
            at Ambala in 1940 to train technical personnel. A Recruits’ Training Centre and a Non-Technical Training Centre were also formed at Lahore.
        </p>
        <p>
            On 15 August 1947, the Air Force training establishments located in India were: (a) Initial Training Wing, Coimbatore (b) Elementary Flying Training School, 
            Jodhpur (c) Service Flying Training School, Ambala (d) No.1 Ground Training School, Jalahalli (e) No.2 Ground Training School, Tambaram

        <h2>Maintenance Command - Nagpur</h2>
        <p>
            The Maintenance Command (MC) is a command of the Indian Air Force (IAF) that is responsible for maintaining, 
            repairing, and overhauling IAF aircraft, equipment, and support equipment. The MC also stores and issues spares for these items. 
            Here are some details about the IAF Maintenance Command:
            <br><strong>History</strong><br>
            The MC was established in 1950 as the Maintenance Group in Chakeri, Kanpur. It was officially designated as 
            the Maintenance Command in 1955. The headquarters of the MC is currently located in Vayusena Nagar, Nagpur, Maharashtra. 
            <br><strong>Structure</strong><br>
            The MC uses Base Repair Depots (BRDs) and Equipment Depots (EDs) to carry out its functions. The BRDs perform fourth
             line maintenance and repairs on IAF aircraft and equipment. 
            <br><strong>Crest and motto</strong><br>
            In 1978, the AOC-in-C gave the BRDs a uniform crest and motto. The crest depicts a phoenix rising from flames with
             a gear wheel around its head. The motto is KAYA KALPA, which means rejuvenation of the body.
