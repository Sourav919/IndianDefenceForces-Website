      <h1>Indian Navy History</h1>
      <p>
        The Indian Navy, a vital component of India's defense forces, has a rich history of protecting the nation’s maritime interests. From ancient naval prowess to modern strategic operations, the Indian Navy has evolved into one of the most formidable naval forces in the world.

        <h2>Early Maritime History</h2>
        <p>
          India has a long tradition of seafaring, with the Indus Valley Civilization (3300–1300 BCE) being among the earliest to engage in maritime activities. Ancient Indian naval forces were engaged in trade and defense, with the Maurya and Gupta empires having strong naval fleets to protect their territories and trade routes.

        <h2>Middle Ages</h2>
        <p>
          During the Middle Ages, maritime trade flourished, especially under the Chola dynasty (9th to 13th century), which is known for its naval power. The Cholas launched successful naval expeditions to Southeast Asia, establishing their dominance in the region. The Maratha Navy, led by legendary leaders like Chhatrapati Shivaji, also emerged during this period.

        <h2>Decline</h2>
        <p>
          The Indian Navy's power declined during the colonial era as the British East India Company and the British Empire took control of the Indian subcontinent’s naval assets. The British Navy dominated the seas, and India's maritime forces were significantly reduced.

        <h2>Later Revival</h2>
        <p>
          After India gained independence in 1947, the Navy was revived and modernized. The Indian Navy began its rebuilding process with the acquisition of ships from the British Navy, including the famous aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, which was commissioned in 1961.

        <h2>East India Company to Independence</h2>
        <p>
          During the British colonial rule, the East India Company’s naval forces became the precursor to the modern Indian Navy. The Indian Navy played an active role during World War II, contributing significantly to the British war effort. After independence, the Indian Navy inherited a largely outdated fleet but began to modernize rapidly.

        <h2>Independence to the End of the 20th Century</h2>
        <p>
          Post-independence, the Indian Navy expanded and modernized, participating in conflicts like the Indo-Pakistani Wars of 1965 and 1971. The Navy’s victory in the 1971 war played a crucial role in the creation of Bangladesh. During this period, the Indian Navy also acquired its first nuclear-powered submarine, INS Arihant, in the 1980s.
